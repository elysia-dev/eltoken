## What is ELYSIA
The ELYSIA Protocol is a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) project that connects the traditional asset financial system and the crypto financial system. So far, the real asset and the cryptocurrency asset financial markets have grown independently in their respective fields. Each area has completely different characteristics, and you can find opposing strengths and weaknesses. For example, the real asset market is fast and easy to monitor and supervise because it is under a centralized system, including government agencies. On the other hand, the cryptocurrency asset market is free and transparent because it is based on a decentralized system using blockchain technology.
